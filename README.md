# Statistical-machine-learning-methods-to-estimates-infection-times-from-deep-sequence-features
This repository contains the code I used for my project on statistical machine learning methods to estimate infection times from deep sequence features. It is written in Python.


I would like to acknowledge that I used part of the code from HIVPhyloTSI, developed by Tanya. The original code can be found at https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/HIV-phyloTSI/blob/main/HIVPhyloTSI.py. Specifically, I used the section that extracts the MAF (Minor Allele Frequency) of the first and second codon across the region.
